# some info
- controls are a little hidden, if you press ```esc``` you can see all the keybindings
- it is not peer-to-peer, requires a server or someone to host a game
- currently does not have lobbies, one server only can host one game
- there are still some bugs for players that join in the middle of the game
- no option to remove objects as of now
